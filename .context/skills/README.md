# Skills

On-demand expertise for AI agents. Skills are task-specific procedures that get activated when relevant.

> Project: MicroSaaSManager

## How Skills Work

1. **Discovery**: AI agents discover available skills
2. **Matching**: When a task matches a skill's description, it's activated
3. **Execution**: The skill's instructions guide the AI's behavior

## Creating Custom Skills

Create a new skill by adding a directory with a `SKILL.md` file:

```
.context/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md          # Required: skill definition
    └── templates/        # Optional: helper resources
        └── checklist.md
```

### SKILL.md Format

```yaml
---
name: my-skill
description: When to use this skill
phases: [P, E, V]  # Optional: PREVC phases
mode: false        # Optional: mode command?
